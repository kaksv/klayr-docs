= Interact with the network
Mona Bärenfänger <mona@lightcurve.io>
:description: The "Interact with the network" page explains the different possibilities for other applications to interact with the blockchain network. For example, an interaction in this regard could be to POST a transaction or to GET account data from the blockchain.

== What does it mean to interact with the network?

Every action that inserts data into the blockchain, or alternatively extracts data from the blockchain is considered an interaction within the blockchain network.

== Who or what interacts with the network?

. *Exchanges* interact heavily with the network.
For example, by transferring tokens for their customers.
It is highly recommended to utilise exchanges to xref:getting-started/maintain-a-node.adoc[set up a node] in order to interact with the network reliably.
. *Delegates* also interact with the network by forging new blocks and adding them to the blockchain.
A delegate is also typically known as a *node operator*.
. *Node operators and developers* also have a general interest in monitoring their node(s) as well as the network.
Their nodes provide them with a private API that can be used to perform different queries, or to post transactions to the network.
Depending on their preferences, node operators may wish to use <<_a_write_scripts_in_javascript,Klayr Elements>>, <<_b_use_the_command_line,Klayr Commander>> or a graphical interface such as <<_c_use_klayr_desktop,Klayr Desktop>>.
. *Applications* interact with the network through the API.
For convenience, applications may use wrappers such as xref:{v_sdk}@klayr-sdk::klayr-elements/packages/api-client.adoc[@klayrHQ/klayr-api-client].
. *KLY Token Holders* mostly interact with the network through Graphical User Interfaces such as wallet applications such as https://klayr.io/desktop[Klayr Desktop or Klayr Mobile].

== How to interact with the network?

[NOTE]
====
The following tools are suited for network interaction with both the Klayr Mainnet and Testnet.

In addition, they can also be used to interact with other blockchain applications that have been developed using the Klayr SDK.
However, in this case it may be necesssary to customize the tools in order to function correctly with these other applications.
====

It is possible to choose up to 5 different methods to interact with an existing network, based on the most convenient and appropriate requirements as described below:

=== A - Write scripts in Javascript

xref:{v_sdk}@klayr-sdk::klayr-elements/index.adoc[Klayr Elements] is a collection of Javascript libraries that help applications to interact with the network.

On the xref:{v_sdk}@klayr-sdk::klayr-elements/packages.adoc[Packages page] of Klayr Elements, all available libraries are listed and documented.

One of the most useful packages in this regard is the xref:{v_sdk}@klayr-sdk::klayr-elements/packages/api-client.adoc[@klayrhq/klayr-api-client] as it provides an efficient and streamlined interface to interact with the network in Javascript.

=== B - Use the Command-line

xref:{v_sdk}@klayr-sdk::klayr-commander/index.adoc[Klayr Commander] is the CLI-tool that allows interaction with the network in a convenient manner through the command line.
Please see the list of all commands and their example responses on the following: xref:{v_sdk}@klayr-sdk::klayr-commander/user-guide/commands.adoc[Commands page].

=== C - Use Klayr Hub

https://klayr.io/hub[Klayr Hub] is the Graphical User Interface (GUI) to interact with the network.

This consists of wallet functionalities, such as sending transactions and viewing account history, including more extended features such as delegate voting or registering as a delegate.

=== D - Klayr Explorer

https://github.com/KlayrHQ/klayr-explorer[Klayr Explorer] is a web application that visualizes the vast information from Klayr’s blockchain.

Klayr offers Explorers for the 2 public networks:

* https://explorer.klayr.io/[Klayr Explorer Mainnet]
* https://testnet-explorer.klayr.io/[Klayr Explorer Testnet]

The source code of Klayr Explorer is open source, and hence can be utilized to set up the user's own Explorers to visualize and monitior the activity inside the network.

=== E - Query the API

Query the https://klayr.io/documentation/klayr-core/api[API] manually.
Either from a public node, or connect to your own private node to interact with the network.

TIP: To view the full specification of the Klayr API including example queries, please see the following https://klayr.io/documentation/klayr-core/api[klayr.io/documentation/klayr-core/api]

To execute the query, use any applicable tool that is suitable for HTTP API requests.

*Popular tools for HTTP requests:*

* https://curl.haxx.se/[Curl]: This performs API requests from the command-line.
* https://www.getpostman.com/[Postman]: This is a user friendly graphical interface for sending API requests.
* https://klayr.io/documentation/klayr-core/api[Swagger UI]: This is a Web interface that can send API requests in addition to providing the complete API specification.

==== Use a public node

There are a number of nodes that are available for public use.

KlayrHQ for example is running a public testnet node that is also used to make https://klayr.io/documentation/klayr-core/api[live requests] whilst trying out the different API endpoints in the documentation.

[TIP]
====
When pressing the "Try it out" button beside each endpoint, it is possible to execute the corresponding API request and receive a live response from the Klayr Testnet.
It will also display the corresponding curl command in order to execute the request from the command-line.
====

==== Use your private node

When xref:getting-started/maintain-a-node.adoc[setting up Klayr Core], the API will be private by default.
Therefore API requests will be only accepted from the localhost.

If it is required to change this, it is possible to define exclusive xref:configuration.adoc#_api_access_control[whitelists] that allow specific addresses to perform API requests on that specific node.

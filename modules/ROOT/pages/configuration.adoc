:description: This explains how to configure Klayr Core. All available command line and configuration options are listed, and also how to manage forging and logging of Klayr Core are clarified.
:toc:
:source-highlighter: coderay
:v_sdk: master

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are using the Docker distribution, Klayr Core is configured in a slightly different manner.
Please go to the xref:administration/docker.adoc#_configuration[Docker Administration] page to find out more about the docker-specific configuration of the Klayr Core.
====

== Command Line Options

Please note, there are numerous options available that can be deployed to override the configuration on the runtime whilst starting the Klayr Core.

To overwrite config options from the Command Line, execute the following commands below:

[tabs]
====
Pass options as ENV variables::
+
--

[source,bash]
----
KLAYR_NETWORK=[network] KLAYR_CONFIG_FILE=[config-path] KLAYR_ADDRESS=[address] KLAYR_WS_PORT=[port] pm2 start klayr
----

--
Pass options as flags::
+
--

WARNING: The flag options are deprecated.
Therefore it is recommend to pass the options as ENV variables.

[source,bash]
----
node dist/index.js -p [port] -a [address] -c [config-path] -n [network]
----

--
====

You can pass `devnet` (default), `alphanet`, `betanet`, `testnet` or `mainnet` for the `[network]` option.

TIP: All `ENV` variables are restricted with a operating system constraint of `ENV` variable maximum length.

[NOTE]
====
Comma-separated lists will replace the original config values.
For example, If `KLAYR_PEERS` is specified, the original `peers.list` specific to the network will be replaced completely.
====

Each of these options listed below can be appended in the command line:

[options="header"]
|===
|Command line Option |ENV Variable |Description

| `--network` +
 `-n`
| `KLAYR_NETWORK`

| Comma separated list of modules, that shall be loaded in a separate process.
To enable inter process communication, set `ipc.enabled` to `true` inside the `config.json` file.
|===

== Network-specific config files

The root folder for all configurations is `config/`.
The *default* network is `devnet`.
To connect to another network, specify the `network` when starting the Klayr Core, as described in <<_command_line_options,Source Administration>>.
The *network specific configurations* can be found under `config/<network>/config.json`, whereby `<network>` can be any of these values listed below:

* `devnet`
* `alphanet`
* `betanet`
* `testnet`
* `mainnet`

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not override any value in the files mentioned above, as the changes will be overwritten everytime the Klayr Core is upgraded.
If a custom configuration is required, use the environment variables or alternatively create your own `.json` file and pass it as <<_command_line_options,command line option>>.
====

== Custom config file

To use a custom config, firstly create a ``.json``-file.
Further information can be found in the <<_structure, Config Structure>> section.

Only the values required to be updated are needed, as for all other options the pre-defined values will be used as described in the <<_config_load_order, Config Load Order>> section.

[NOTE]
====
*Binary* and *Commander* distributions both provide a config.json, which can be customized as desired.

For *Source* distributions, the config file needs to be created seperately and needs to be passed as described below:
====

[tabs]
=====
Binary::
+
--
The binary script provides a custom `config.json` which is stored in the root folder of your Klayr Core installation by default.

For example, Klayr Core for Mainnet is installed under `~/klayr-main`, and the config is stored directly in `~/klayr-main/config.json`

The config.json will be used automatically when reloading the node with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
bash klayr.sh reload
----
--
Commander::
+
--
Klayr Commander provides a custom `config.json` which is stored in the root folder of your Klayr Core instance by default.

For example, Klayr Core for Mainnet is installed under `~/.klayr/instances/klayr-mainnet`, and the config is stored directly in `~/.klayr/instances/klayr-main/config.json`

The config.json will be used automatically when reloading the node with the following command:
--
Source::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
pm2 stop klayr <1>
KLAYR_CONFIG_FILE=<CONFIG_PATH> pm2 start klayr <2>
----
<1> Stop Klayr Core in the case whereby it is running.
<2> Replace `<CONFIG_PATH>` with the path to your custom config file.
--
=====

== Config load order

Configurations will be loaded in the following order listed below.
Each configuration will override the previous one:

. Default configuration values of modules and components of the xref:{v_sdk}@klayr-sdk::klayr-framework/index.adoc[Klayr Framework]
. <<_network_specific_config_files, Network specific configuration file>>
. A <<_command_line_options,custom configuration file>> (if specified by the user)
. <<_command_line_options,Command line configurations>>, specified as command-line flags or `ENV` variables.

For development purposes, use `devnet` as the network option.
Other networks are specific to public Klayr networks.

The `config.json` file and a description of each configurable parameter.

== Structure

A breakdown of the code structure can be seen below:

include::../../ROOT/partials/configuration.adoc[]

== API Access Control

Controlling access to a node plays a vital role in security.
The following configurable flags are available to control the access to your node:

[source%linenums,js]
----
{
  "modules": {
    "http_api": { <1>
      "enabled": true, <2>
      "access": { <3>
        "public": false, <4>
        "whiteList": ["127.0.0.1"], <5>
      },
    }
  }
}
----

<1> Contains options for the API module.
<2> Controls the API's availability.
If disabled, no API access is possible.
<3> Contains API access options.
<4> If true, the API endpoints of the node are available to public.
<5> This parameter allows connections to the API by IP. Defaults to only allow local host.

The recommended setup is to configure a whitelist for only trusted IP addresses, such as your home connection.
Use IPV4 addresses only as the whitelist does not support IPV6.

To set up a public wallet, simply leave the `modules.http_api.access.whitelist` array empty.

For optimal security, disable all access setting `modules.http_api.enabled` to `false`.

NOTE: This last configuration may prevent monitoring scripts from functioning.

== Forging

To enable your node to forge, firstly it is required to insert some encrypted data into the config file under the `chain.forging.delegates` array.
To encrypt your passphrase, it is recommended to use one of the following alternatives listed below:

* xref:{v_sdk}@klayr-sdk::klayr-commander/user-guide/commands.adoc[Klayr Commander] via `encrypt passphrase` command.
* xref:{v_sdk}@klayr-sdk::klayr-elements/packages/cryptography.adoc[Cryptography module of Klayr Elements]

The first alternative with the Klayr Commander is described in detail below.
Please ensure the Klayr Commander is installed in a secure environment.
Upon completion, please follow these commands to generate the encrypted passphrase:

[source,bash]
----
$ klayr
klayr passphrase:encrypt --output-public-key
Please enter your secret passphrase: *****
Please re-enter your secret passphrase: *****
Please enter your password: ***
Please re-enter your password: ***
{
        "encryptedPassphrase": "iterations=1000000&cipherText=30a3c8&iv=b0d7322bf24e0dfe08462f4f&salt=aa7e26c9f4317b61b4f45b5c6909f941&tag=a2e0eadaf1f11a10b342965bc3bafc68&version=1",
        "publicKey": "a4465fd76c16fcc458448076372abf1912cc5b150663a64dffefe550f96feadd"
}
----

. Type in your passphrase followed by the password required for encryption.
. This will result in the creation of an `encryptedPassphrase` key-value pair.
. Create the JSON object and add it to your `config.json` under `chain.forging.delegates` as can be seen below:

[source,js,linenums]
----
{
  "modules": {
    "chain": { <1>
      "forging": { <2>
        "force": false, <3>
        "delegates": [ <4>
            {
                "encryptedPassphrase": "iterations=1&salt=476d4299531718af8c88156aab0bb7d6&cipherText=663dde611776d87029ec188dc616d96d813ecabcef62ed0ad05ffe30528f5462c8d499db943ba2ded55c3b7c506815d8db1c2d4c35121e1d27e740dc41f6c405ce8ab8e3120b23f546d8b35823a30639&iv=1a83940b72adc57ec060a648&tag=b5b1e6c6e225c428a4473735bc8f1fc9&version=1",
                "publicKey": "9d3058175acab969f41ad9b86f7a2926c74258670fe56b37c429c01fca9f2f0f"
            }
        ],
      },
    },
    "http_api": { <5>
      "forging": {
        "access": {
          "whiteList": ["127.0.0.1", "REPLACE_ME"], <6>
        },
      },
    }
  }
}
----

<1> Contains options for the chain module.
<2> Contains forging options for delegates.
<3> Forces forging to be 'on'.
This is only used on local development networks.
<4> The list of delegates who are allowed to forge on this node.
To successfully enable forging for a delegate, the public key and the encrypted passphrase need to be deposited here as a JSON object.
<5> Contains options for the API module.
<6> Replace with the IP which will be used to access your node

[arabic,start=4]
. Reload your Klayr Core process to make the changes in the config effective.
For example, for Binary install, run the following command: `bash klayr.sh reload`

=== Check Forging

Use the following `curl` command to verify the forging status of your delegate as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
curl \
  http://127.0.0.1:7000/api/node/status/forging \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json'
----

The result should appear as shown below in the following code snippet:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "meta": {},
  "data": [
    {
      "forging": true,
      "publicKey": "9bc945f92141d5e11e97274c275d127dc7656dda5c8fcbf1df7d44827a732664"
    }
  ],
  "links": {}
}
----

=== Enable/Disable Forging

IMPORTANT: Remember that after restarting your Klayr node, it is necessary to re-enable forging again.

[TIP]
====
The endpoint to perform this action is *idempotent*.

This means that the results are identical, regardless of how many times the query is executed.
====

If your Klayr Node is running on a local machine, it is possible to enable forging through the API client, without any further interruption.

Use the following curl command to *enable the forging* for your delegate as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X PUT \
  http://127.0.0.1:7000/api/node/status/forging \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
          "publicKey": "YYYYYYYYY",
          "password": "XXX",
          "forging": true
      }'
----

Use the following curl command to *disable the forging* for your delegate as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X PUT \
  http://127.0.0.1:7000/api/node/status/forging \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
          "publicKey": "YYYYYYYYY",
          "password": "XXX",
          "forging": false
      }'
----

* `publicKey` is the key for the delegate which is required to be enabled/disabled.
* `password` is the password used to encrypt your passphrase in `config.json`
* `forging` is the boolean value to enable or disable the forging.
* The HTTP Port can be different based on your configuration, therefore it is recommended to check the `httpPort` in your `config.json`

== SSL

[TIP]
====
It is recommended to use a webserver such as https://www.nginx.com/[NGINX] or https://httpd.apache.org/[Apache] to set up the SSL for the Klayr Core.
If that opportunity is not available then it is also possible to configure the Klayr Core to handle SSL connections as described below:
====

[NOTE]
====
This step requires a signed certificate, (from a CA, such as https://letsencrypt.org[Let’s Encrypt]) or a self-signed certificate.
Both the private and public keys will be needed in a location that is accessible to Klayr Core.
====

The following code snippet listed below displays the essential parameters required to enable SSL security on your node’s connections:

*SSL Configuration*

[source,js,linenums]
----
{
  "modules": {
      "http_api": {
          "ssl": {
              "enabled": false,           <1>
              "options": {
                  "port": 443,            <2>
                  "address": "0.0.0.0",   <3>
                  "key": "path_to_key",   <4>
                  "cert": "path_to_cert"  <5>
              }
          }
      }
  }
}
----

<1> Change from false to true.
<2> Default SSL Port.
<3> Change only if it is required to block web access to the node.
<4> Replace `path_to_key` with the actual path to the key file.
<5> Replace `path_to_cert` with the actual path to the certificate file.

WARNING: If the SSL Port configured above in `http_api.ssl.options.port` is a privileged port, (below 1024), then either the node must be allowed to use the specified port with `setcap`, or the configuration must be changed in order to to use a port outside of that range.

*Setcap:* This is only required to grant Klayr access to port 443.

[source,bash]
----
 sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep bin/node
----

To verify your node has been configured correctly, open the web client using this url: `https://MY_IP_OR_HOST`.
A secure SSL connection should now be visible.

== Logging

For monitoring or debugging your node, Klayr Core tracks all activities that occur within the node by creating applicable log messages.

These log messages are grouped in different log levels.
Hence, this makes it easy to define the level of the log details.

https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan[Bunyan] is used for the logging library, as this allows simple and fast JSON logging for Node.js services.

=== Log Levels

[width="100%",cols="8%,92%",options="header",]
|===
|Log Level |Description
|None |No events are logged.

|Fatal(60) |The node is going to stop or become unusable. This requires
the operator to investigate the problem.

|Error(50) |Fatal for a particular request, however the node continues
servicing other requests. This also requires
the operator to investigate the problem, although it does not necessarily require immediate attention.

|Warn(40) |A warning indication that should be investigated eventually.

|Info(30) |Detail on a regular operation.

|Debug(20) |Anything else, i.e. too verbose to be included in ``info''
level.

|Trace(10) |Logging from external libraries used by your node, or else very
detailed application logging.
|===

=== Logging destinations

There are two possible output sources for the logs: The `*file log stream*` and the `*console log stream*`.
Each output source can be configured independently inside of `config.json` under the options for the `logger` component.

==== Console log stream

The console log level displays the logs directly to the console from where the Klayr Core process is started.
It is useful for quick debugging or verifying that Klayr Core starts correctly.
Default log level for the console log stream is `none`.

*An example command displaying the console log stream can be seen below:*

[source,bash]
----
node dist/index.js | npx bunyan  <1>
----

<1> Pretty-prints console logs with log level equal or higher to the console log level.

For more information regarding the Bunyan CLI tool, please refer to the official http://trentm.com/node-bunyan/bunyan.1.html[Bunyan Documentation].

==== File log stream

All logs that have equal or higher log levels than the in `config.json` specified file log level are saved in a `.log`-file for further analysis.
By default, the generated log files are saved inside of the `logs` folder of Klayr Core.
Default log level for the file log stream is `info`.

The file log stream can be used to xref:monitoring.adoc#_log_monitoring[monitor the node via logs].

=== Logrotation

It is recommended to set up some form of log rotation for the log files of Klayr Core.
If log rotation is not initiated, then the log files may grow very large over time, (depending on the specified file log level), and hence will eventually exceed the server's disk space limits.

For example, Ubuntu systems  provide a service called `logrotate` specifically for this purpose.
Please ensure Logrotate is installed on your system as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
logrotate --version
----

Now go to the logrotate config directory and create a new logrotate file for Klayr Core as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
cd /etc/logrotate.d
touch klayr
----

Inside this file, define the parameters for the log rotation.

Example values can be seen below:

[source,bash]
----
/path/to/klayr/logs/mainnet/*.log {
        daily                   <1>
        rotate 5                <2>
        maxage 14               <3>
        compress                <4>
        delaycompress           <5>
        missingok               <6>
        notifempty              <7>
}
----

<1> Daily rotation.
<2> Keeps the last 5 most recent logs.
<3> Removes logs that are older than 14 days.
<4> Compresses old log files.
<5> Compresses the data after it has been moved.
<6> If no log file is present, then it is ignored.
<7> Does not rotate empty log files.

After customizing and saving the config to fit your requirements, it is recommended to test it by doing a dry run using the following command listed below:

[source,bash]
----
sudo logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf --debug
----

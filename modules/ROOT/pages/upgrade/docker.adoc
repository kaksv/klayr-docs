= Klayr Core Docker Upgrade

:description: The Klayr Core Docker Upgrade page describes how to upgrade Klayr Core to the latest version with Docker.
:toc:

== Upgrade minor versions

To upgrade a Klayr installation using Docker Compose you simply need to export the new version number in `ENV_KLAYR_VERSION`.

Example: Upgrade from Klayr Core 2.0.0 to 2.1.1 by executing:

[source,bash]
----
export ENV_KLAYR_VERSION=2.1.1
docker-compose up -d
----

To upgrade the Klayr installation run `docker-compose up -d`.

== Upgrade major versions

For major version upgrades, there can be additional changes in `docker-compose.yml`.

In this case, Klayr Core provides an updated version of `docker-compose.yml` in the https://github.com/KlayrHQ/klayr-core[Klayr Core repository] on Github, inside the `docker` folder: `https://github.com/KlayrHQ/klayr-core/tree/<CURRENT_VERSION>/docker`

(Where `<CURRENT_VERSION>` is the https://github.com/KlayrHQ/klayr-core/tags[version tag] of the version you want to upgrade to.)

Use this file as a new template for your `docker-compose.yml`.

The rest of the upgrade process is analog to the <<_upgrade_minor_versions,minor version upgrade>>.

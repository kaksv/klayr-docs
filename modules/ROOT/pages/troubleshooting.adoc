:description: The Klayr Core Troubleshooting page provides solutions for the most common problems that can occur while installing or managing Klayr Core.
:toc:

== Setup

=== A process is already listening on port 5432 (Binary)

==== Problem:

After running `+installKlayr.sh+`, the installation script is aborted
with the following output:

....
Error: A process is already listening on port 5432
PostgreSQL by default listens on 127.0.0.1:5432 and attempting to run two instances at the same time will result in this installation failing
To proceed anyway, use the -i flag to ignore the warning.
....

PostgreSQL is already installed on your system and listening to the
PostgreSQL default port 5432. This can happen e.g. when a second Klayr
Core node is installed on the same server.

====
Solution 1::
+
--
If postgreSQL has been installed globally on the system, disable it:

[source,bash]
----
sudo systemctl stop postgresql
sudo systemctl disable postgresql
----

Possible data inside of databases remains stored in this case.
--
Solution 2::
+
--
If postgreSQL has been installed globally on the system and the data in
it is not needed anymore, simply remove the already installed postgreSQL
by running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get --purge remove postgresql postgresql-doc postgresql-common
----

=== Role klayr does not exist (Source)

==== Problem:

Starting the Klayr node fails with error:

....
error: role "klayr" does not exist
....

Klayr Core expects a Postgres user called `klayr` exists on the system and has the rights to create a database.
This user is specified in `config.json`.
If the user is not present on the system, the above error will be thrown.

[tabs]
====
Solution 1 - create klayr user::
+
--
Create a Postgres user with name `klayr` and grant it the right to create databases.

[source,bash]
----
  sudo -u postgres createuser --createdb klayr
----
--
Solution 2 - change db.user from klayr to custom username::
+
--
Edit xref:configuration.adoc[`config.json`] and replace the value `klayr` in `db.user` with an alternative Postgres username on the system, that has the right to create databases.
--
====

=== Nothing shown in the console after starting Klayr Core (Source)

==== Problem:

After installing from Source and starting Klayr Core with `node dist/index.js`, no are logs visible in the console.
This is, in fact, an expected behavior, as the default console logging value in the config is `none`, which means no logs are shown in the console after starting the process.

===== Solution:

To verify, that your installation works as expected, you can change
the`+consoleLogLevel+` to `error`, `info` or `debug`.
Alternatively, you can check the log files located in `logs/`, which are on `info` logging level by default.

== Administration

=== Enable forging: Delegate not found

==== Problem:

When trying to activate forging on your node, it answers with
`Delegate with publicKey: xyz not found`

[tabs]
====
Solution 1 - Node still syncing::
+
--
Check the current height of your Node and compare it with the Height in Explorer.
If your Nodes’ height is significantly lower than the height shown in the Explorer, it means your Node is still syncing/downloading the Klayr Blockchain.
At this time, enabling forging might fail, because the Delegate registration has not been downloaded, yet.
To solve it, just wait until your Node is fully synced.
--
Solution 2 - Missing data in config ::
+
--
Check your `config.json` in section `forging.delegates`.
If you want to enable forging for a particular delegate on your node, you need to store an object with the delegates’ public key and encrypted passphrase in that section as described in the xref:configuration.adoc#_forging[configuration:forging] section.
--
====

=== Enable forging: Invalid password and public key combination

==== Problem:

When trying to activate forging on a node like described in section xref:configuration.adoc#_enabledisable_forging[Enable/Disable forging], it responds with: `{"message":"\"Invalid password and public key combination\""}`.

==== Solution:
As the message states, the provided combination of your delegates publicKey and the password don’t seem to be valid.
Please ensure, both properties are set to the correct values, especially that you don’t use the original passphrase of your account with that command.

[NOTE]
====
We further explain the chosen naming to avoid confusion:

* *Passphrase* is always referring to your 12-word long mnemonic passphrase that was created at the same time as your Klayr ID.
You should always keep this secure and private!
For communication with the API, the passphrase is not passed in plaintext.
Instead, the password is passed so you use it to encrypt your passphrase and the encrypted passphrase is stored in your xref:configuration.adoc[config].
* *Password* is always referring to the secret word/s you use to encrypt your passphrase symmetrically like described in the xref:configuration.adoc#_forging[Forging section].

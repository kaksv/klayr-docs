When the logic inside a custom transaction becomes more complex, it becomes complicated to verify that the custom transaction logic is working as expected.

Therefore it is recommended to write {url_unit_tests}[unit tests^], that verify the logic of the transaction.

Especially for verifying the code of the `undoAsset()` function, it is convenient to write unit tests.
This is due to the fact that the code in the `undoAsset()` function is only executed if the node discovers itself on a fork with the main chain.

[NOTE]
====
To be on a **fork** means that the node added some different blocks to the chain than its peers.
In order to sync again with the network, it has to remove the blocks that are different, and undo the transactions inside these blocks.
To undo the transaction, the `undoAsset()` function will be called for each transaction inside of the blocks that need to be reverted.
====

In order to explain how to write unit tests for custom transactions, the `applyAsset()` method of the {url_github_hello_world}[Hello World app^] is used here as example.
It can be used as a template to write unit tests for your own custom transactions.

NOTE: To test the complete logic of a custom transaction, it is required to write unit tests for all methods that are implemented in the custom transactions: `validateAsset()`, `applyAsset()` and `undoAsset()`.

== Write a test script

First, let's look at the `applyAsset()` function of the {url_github_hello_world_tx}[HelloTransaction^].

.Snippet of undoAsset(), File: hello_world/transactions/hello_transaction.js
[source,js]
----
applyAsset(store) {
    const errors = [];
    const sender = store.account.get(this.senderId);
    if (sender.asset && sender.asset.hello) {
        errors.push(
            new TransactionError(
                'You cannot send a hello transaction multiple times',
                sender.asset.hello,
                '.asset.hello',
                this.asset.hello
            )
        );
    } else {
        const newObj = { ...sender, asset: { hello: this.asset.hello } };
        store.account.set(sender.address, newObj);
    }
    return errors;
}
----

To test that the `applyAsset()` function is working as expected, write a unit test with {url_jest}[jest^]: {url_github_hello_world_tx_test}[hello_transaction.test.js^]:

.File: transactions/tests/register-packet.test.js

const HelloTransaction = require('../hello_transaction');
const {TransactionError, utils} = require('@klayrhq/klayr-transactions');

    });

    it('should save the hello string in the senders account assets', async () => { <2>

<1> The `get()` and `set()` functions of the `stateStore` are mocked by creating {url_wiki_stubs}[stubs^] in the `beforeEach()` function.
Stubbing provides the opportunity to replace the call of a function with a custom return value.
<2> Now the first test can begin, with a short and precise description of the actual test itself.
<3> When `storeStub.account.get` is called with `asset.senderId`,the return value is replaced with the `mockedSenderAccount`.
<4> A new transaction is created.
<5> The `applyAsset()` function of the transaction is called, and the previousely defined `storeStub` is passed to the `applyAsset()` function.
<6> The test passes if the function `storeStub.account.set()` is called with the expected parameters.

The first test verifies that the hello string is saved in the senders account assets.
Therefore, a check is performed to ensure that the `storeStub.account.set()` was called with the correct parameters:

.Sender address
[source,js]
----
mockedSenderAccount.address,
----

and
.Updated sender account
[source,js]
----
{
    address: mockedSenderAccount.address,
    publicKey: 'c094ebee7ec0c50ebee32918655e089f6e1a604b83bcaa760293c61e0f18ab6f',
    asset,
}
----
If the function was called with the expected parameters, then this proves that the sender account was updated correctly.

In the second test it is necessary to verify that the transaction is rejected, in the case whereby the sender already has a hello string in their account.
Therefore, it is necessary to check if the expected `TransactionError` is returned when the `applyAsset()` is executed.

.Expected transaction error
[source,js]
----
new TransactionError(
    'You cannot send a hello transaction multiple times',
    mockedSenderAccount.asset.hello,
    '.asset.hello',
    asset.hello
)
----

== Run the test script

To run the test from the command-line, install {url_jest}[jest^]:

[source,bash]
----
npm install jest --global
----

Now, run the test:

[source,bash]
----
jest hello_transaction.test.js
----
It should print the test results.
For example:
....
PASS  ./hello_transaction.test.js
  Hello Transaction
    ✓ should save the hello string in the senders account assets (10ms)
    ✓ should reject the transaction, if the sender has already a hello string in their account. (1ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       2 passed, 2 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        2.132s
Ran all test suites matching /hello_transaction.test.js/i.
....

In the example above, all expectations were met and the test passed.

== What else needs to be tested?
Is writing unit tests really enough to ensure the functionality of a custom transaction type?

**Short answer: The unit tests are sufficient.**

**Explanation:** You may wonder if it is required to write additional functional and integration tests.
Be aware, that the correct reading and writing of the data to the database is already part of the Klayr SDK software testing and therefore it is not needed to test it again for your new custom transaction type.
Therefore unit tests are generally sufficient to test the functionality of a custom transaction type.

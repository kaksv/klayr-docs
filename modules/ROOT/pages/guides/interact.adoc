This guides describes how to interact with a blockchain network powered by the Klayr SDK.

To interact with the blockchain, communicate with the API of a node, that is connected to the network.

[NOTE]
====
By default, it is only allowed to make API requests to a node from the localhost.

To make API requests from remote, use a node with a public API, or deploy your own node and xref:{url_guides_config}[whitelist] your IP to make API requests.
====

== Common interactions

Some examples for most common interactions are listed here.

For JavaScript developers, it is most convenient to use the xref:{url_reference_elements_apiclient}[@klayrhq/klayr-api-client].

First install it with npm:

.In the terminal
[source,bash]
----
npm i @klayrhq/klayr-api-client
----

Then require it as dependency and create the API client:

.In a javascript file
[source,js]
----
const { APIClient } = require('@klayrhq/klayr-api-client');

const API_BASEURL = "http://localhost:4000"; <1>
const api = new APIClient([API_BASEURL]);
----

<1> Replace `http://localhost:4000` with the address of the node, you want to send the API request to.

[TIP]
====
It is of course possible to write an API client based on other languages than javascript and typescript.

It is also possible to do the API requests directly from the command line with programs like {url_curl}[curl^] or xref:{url_reference_commander}[Klayr Commander].
====

=== Get transactions

.Syntax
[source,js]
----
api.transactions.get(options)
----

Where `options` can be any of the params described in the xref:{url_reference_api_tx_get}[API specification: GET /transactions]

.Get transaction by ID
[source,js]
----
const { APIClient } = require('@klayrhq/klayr-api-client');

const API_BASEURL = "http://localhost:4000";
const api = new APIClient([API_BASEURL]);

api.transactions.get({ id: '222675625422353767' })
    .then(res => {
        console.log(res.data);
    })
----

.Get transaction by recipient ID
[source,js]
----
const { APIClient } = require('@klayrhq/klayr-api-client');

const API_BASEURL = "http://localhost:4000";
const api = new APIClient([API_BASEURL]);

api.transactions.get({ recipientId: '123L' })
    .then(res => {
        console.log(res.data);
    });
----

=== Get blocks

.Syntax
[source,js]
----
api.blocks.get(options)
----

Where `options` can be any of the params described in the xref:{url_reference_api_blocks_get}[API specification: GET /blocks]

.Get block by height
[source,js]
----
const { APIClient } = require('@klayrhq/klayr-api-client');

const API_BASEURL = "http://localhost:4000";
const api = new APIClient([API_BASEURL]);

api.blocks.get({ height: '123456' })
    .then(res => {
        console.log(res.data);
    });
----

=== Get accounts

.Syntax
[source,js]
----
api.accounts.get(options)
----

Where `options` can be any of the params described in the xref:{url_reference_api_account_get}[API specification: GET /accounts]

.Get all accounts
[source,js]
----
const { APIClient } = require('@klayrhq/klayr-api-client');

const API_BASEURL = "http://localhost:4000";
const api = new APIClient([API_BASEURL]);

let offset = 0;
let accounts = [];
const accountsArray = [];

do {
    const retrievedAccounts = await api.accounts.get({ limit: 100, offset });
    accounts = retrievedAccounts.data;
    accountsArray.push(...accounts);

    if (accounts.length === 100) {
        offset += 100;
    }
} while (accounts.length === 100);
----

=== Create new accounts

First it is needed to generate a mnemonic passphrase, which will be the 12 word passphrase that belongs to the new account.

This passphrase is then used to generate a public/private key pair that is now associated to the account, too.

Last but not least an `address` is generated, also referred to as the "account ID".

While all these properties belong now to this specific account, it is important to notice what information is public, and what needs to be kept private.

.Private properties
* `passphrase`: The 12 word mnemonic passphrase, keep this private and safe!
If gets lost, the access to the funds of this account is lost as well.
* `privateKey`: The cryptographic representation of the human-readable `passphrase`.

.Public properties
* `address`: The public address of this account.
Example: 12345L
* `publicKey`: The cryptographic representation of the human-readable `address`.

.Create new account credentials
[source,js]
----
const cryptography = require('@klayrhq/klayr-cryptography');
const { Mnemonic } = require('@klayrhq/klayr-passphrase');

const createCredentials = () => {
    const passphrase = Mnemonic.generateMnemonic();
    const keys = cryptography.getPrivateAndPublicKeyFromPassphrase(
        passphrase
    );
    const credentials = {
        address: cryptography.getAddressFromPublicKey(keys.publicKey),
        passphrase: passphrase,
        publicKey: keys.publicKey,
        privateKey: keys.privateKey
    };
    return credentials;
};

const credentials = createCredentials();

console.log(credentials);
----

[NOTE]
====
You might have noticed that for creating a new account, we actually did not send any API request to the network.
That means there is no record yet about this account on the blockchain.

For this account to become part of the blockchain, it is necessary to transfer at least 1 token to the newly created account.

This balance transfer will create a new record for the account on the blockchain.
====

To ensure that no other user can generate the same address from a different passphrase (what can happen), it is needed to initialize the new account, by sending an outgoing transaction.

This initialization will bind your public key to the address, and ensure the account cannot be hijacked later on.

.Example: Initializing an account by sending a transfer transaction
[source,js]
----
const { APIClient } = require('@klayrhq/klayr-api-client');
const transactions = require('@klayrhq/klayr-transactions');
const {getNetworkIdentifier} = require('@klayrhq/klayr-cryptography');
// Generate the network identifier for Devnet
const networkIdentifier = getNetworkIdentifier(
    "23ce0366ef0a14a91e5fd4b1591fc880ffbef9d988ff8bebf8f3666b0c09597d",
    "Klayr",
);
const API_BASEURL = "http://localhost:4000";
const api = new APIClient([API_BASEURL]);

let tx = new transactions.TransferTransaction({
    asset: {
        amount: '1',
        recipientId: '12345678L',
    },
    networkIdentifier: networkIdentifier,
});
// Replace the passphrase with the passphrase of the newly created account
tx.sign('creek own stem final gate scrub live shallow stage host concert they');

api.transactions.broadcast(tx.toJSON()).then(res => {
    console.log("++++++++++++++++ API Response +++++++++++++++++");
    console.log(res.data);
    console.log("++++++++++++++++ Transaction Payload +++++++++++++++++");
    console.log(tx.stringify());
    console.log("++++++++++++++++ End Script +++++++++++++++++");
}).catch(err => {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(err.errors, null, 2));
});
----

[TIP]
====
To initialize an account conveniently, transfer the funds to back itself.
Just replace the value of `recipientId` with the account address.

In this case, only the transaction fee needs to be paid to initialize the account.
====

If the API responds with a success message in `res.data`, the transaction was broadcasted successfully.

=== Send transactions

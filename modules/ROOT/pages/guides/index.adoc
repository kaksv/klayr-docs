This section consists of concise, goal-oriented how-to guides that are designed in a manner to help the user solve specific issues.

The guides are listed in chronological order, walking the user through the basic steps of developing a blockchain application with the Klayr SDK.

== Main Guides

The most important parts of building a blockchain application are described below:

. The xref:{url_config}[configuration guide] covers how to configure a blockchain application and how to modify the default values.
. The xref:{url_custom}[custom transactions guide] explains how to add and register a new transaction type.
. In the xref:{url_frontend}[connect a frontend guide], how to develop a {url_react}[React^] frontend for a blockchain application is explained.
. Finally, the xref:{url_launch}[launch the app guide] describes the steps needed to move from a local devnet to a public blockchain network.

== The Hello World app

As an example, the guides use the {url_github_hello}[Hello World^] app, which contains a very basic blockchain application with one custom transaction type and a simple frontend.

This basic example describes a minimal set of code which is required to implement a blockchain application.

If you wish to follow the guides on a 1-to-1 basis, it is recommend to set up the 'Hello World' app as described below.

Alternatively it is possible to start directly with your own use case, or a xref:{url_tutorials}[tutorial], and then refer back to the guides for further detailed information on certain specific topics, as and when required.

To set up the Hello World app, first install the xref:{url_setup}[prerequisites], then clone the repository and navigate into it as shown below:

.In the terminal
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/KlayrHQ/klayr-sdk-examples.git
cd klayr-sdk-examples/hello_world
----

Now install all required node modules for the node application by executing the following command below:

.klayr-sdk-examples/hello_world
[source,bash]
----
npm install
----

The next step is to spin up the devnet node by executing the following command:

.klayr-sdk-examples/hello_world
[source,bash]
----
node index.js | npx bunyan -o short
----

If the setup was successful, it will be possible to view the logs of the node in the terminal.

Once the node is started, it will spin up a local devnet with only one node, and all 101 genesis delegates forging on that node.
The delegates will then add a new block to the blockchain, which will also be visible in the logs every 10 seconds.

All remaining topics of the Hello World application are explained further in the dedicated Klayr SDK guides.

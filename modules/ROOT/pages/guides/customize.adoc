== Custom transactions

Transactions are an essential part of blockchain applications that are created using the Klayr SDK, as they define the set of actions that can be performed by users in the network.
Each transaction belongs to a specific *transaction type* that is registered in the network.

The Klayr SDK provides a <<interface,BaseTransaction interface>> from which developers can extend from, to create custom transactions.

[[hello_transaction]]
== Example of a custom transaction type: The `HelloTransaction`

    BaseTransaction,
    TransactionError
} = require('@klayrhq/klayr-transactions');

    * Every time a user posts a transaction to the network, the transaction fee is paid to the delegate who includes the transaction into the block that the delegate forges.
    */
    static get FEE () {
        return `${10 ** 8}`; // (= 1 KLY)
    };

    /**
    * Prepares the necessary data for the `apply` and `undo` step.

			},
		]);

== Register a custom transaction type

Add a custom transaction type to a blockchain application by registering it to the application instance as shown below:

.Contents of index.js
[source,js]
----
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet} = require('klayr-sdk');
const HelloTransaction = require('./hello_transaction'); <1>

configDevnet.app.label = 'hello-world-blockchain-app';
//configDevnet.components.storage.user = 'klayr';
//configDevnet.components.storage.password = 'password';

const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet);
app.registerTransaction(HelloTransaction); <2>

app
    .run()
    .then(() => app.logger.info('App started...'))
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Faced error in application', error);
        process.exit(1);
    });
----
<1> Imports the custom transaction type.
<2> Registers the custom transaction type with the application.

TIP: For more information on creating your own custom transaction types, please xref:{url_tutorials}[follow the tutorials].

[[default_transactions]]
== Default transaction types

[IMPORTANT]
====
Transaction types 0-12 are reserved for the Klayr protocol.
Do not use these to register custom transactions.
====

Each default transaction type implements a different use case of the Klayr network.

TIP: For a complete list of all default transaction types, please see the section Klayr transactions of the Klayr Protocol.

[[interface]]
== The BaseTransaction interface

The BaseTransaction class is the interface that all other transaction types - including the <<default_transactions,default transaction types>> - need to inherit from, in order to be compatible with the Klayr SDK.

TIP: See the {url_github_base_transaction}[BaseTransaction^] in the `klayr-sdk` repository on Github.

=== Required properties

The following properties and methods need to be implemented by a custom transaction type, when extending from the `BaseTransaction`:

==== TYPE

The type is a unique identifier for your custom transaction within your own blockchain application. This can be thought of as the hallmark of a transaction. Set this constant to any number, except 0-12, which are reserved for the default transactions.

[source,js]
----
static TYPE: number
----

=== Required methods

==== prepare

[source,js]
----
prepare(store: StateStorePrepare): Promise<void>
----

In `prepare()` the data from the database is filtered and cached, that is needed in the `applyAsset` and `undoAsset` functions later.

==== validateAsset

[source,js]
----
validateAsset(): ReadonlyArray<TransactionError>
----

Before a transaction reaches the apply step it is validated.
Check the transaction’s asset correctness from the schema perspective, (no access to StateStore here).
Invalidate the transaction by pushing an error into the result array.
Prepare the relevant information about the accounts, which will be accessible in the later steps during the `apply` and `undo` steps.

==== applyAsset

[source,js]
----
applyAsset(store: StateStore): ReadonlyArray<TransactionError>
----

The business logic of a transaction is implemented in the `applyAsset` method.
It applies all of the necessary changes from the received transaction to the affected account(s), by calling `store.set`.
Calling `store.get` will acquire all of the relevant data.
The transaction that is currently processing is the function’s context, (e.g. `this.amount`).
This transaction can be invalidated by pushing an error into the result array.

==== undoAsset

[source,js]
----
undoAsset(store: StateStore): ReadonlyArray<TransactionError>
----

The inversion of the `applyAsset` method.
Undoes all of the changes to the accounts applied by the `applyAsset` step.

=== Additional methods

To increase your application’s performance, the following functions should be overidden: `verifyAgainstTransactions`, `assetFromSync`, `fromSync`.

The BaseTransaction provides the default implementation of the methods revolving around the signatures.
As your application matures it is possible to implement custom methods of how your transaction’s signature is derived: `sign`, `getBytes`, `assetToBytes`.

== Best practice: Always extend a custom transaction type from the `BaseTransaction`

It is also possible to extend from one of the default transactions or other custom transactions, in order to extend or modify them.

In most cases though, this is not recommended because updates in the logic of the inherited transaction can break the logic of the custom transaction.

To avoid the possibility of incompatibilities, always extend from the `BaseTransaction`:

.Extending from the `BaseTransaction`
[source,js]
----
const {
    BaseTransaction,
    TransactionError
} = require('@klayrhq/klayr-transactions');

class HelloTransaction extends BaseTransaction {
[...]
----

== The Store

The Store is responsible for the caching and accessing transaction and account data.
The `store` is available inside the `prepare()`, `applyAsset()` and `undoAsset()` methods and provides methods to get and set the data from the database.

=== Cache

.How to cache data from the database
[source,js]
----
async prepare(store) {
    await store.account.cache([
        {
            address: this.senderId,
        },
    ]);
}
----

=== Filters

Depending on the datatype, there are different filters that can be applied, when caching accounts or transactions from the database.

The following table gives an overview, which filters are available, depending on the datatype of the filtered data.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Filter Type |Filter Suffixes |Description
|BOOLEAN |_eql | returns entries that match the value
| |_ne | returns entries that do not match the value
|TEXT |_eql | returns entries that match the value
| |_ne | returns entries that do not match the value
| |_in | returns entries that match any of values from the list
| |_like | returns entries that match the pattern
|NUMBER |_eql | returns entries that match the value
| |_ne | returns entries that do not match the value
| |_gt | returns entries greater than the value
| |_gte | returns entries greater than or equal to the value
| |_lt | returns entries less than the value
| |_lte | returns entries less than or equal to the value
| |_in | returns entries that match any of values from the list
|===

.All available filters on GitHub
[TIP]
====
* {url_github_sdk_entities_tx}[Filter for transactions^]
* {url_github_sdk_entities_account}[Filter for accounts^]
====

.Caches all accounts in the list
[source,js]
----
async prepare(store) {
    await store.account.cache({
	    address_in: [
            "16152155423726476379L",
            "12087516173140285171L",
        ],
    });
}
----

.Join different filters with OR combinator
[source,js]
----
async prepare(store) {
    await store.account.cache([
        {
            isDelegate_eq: false,
        },
        {
            balance_gt: 0,
        }
    ]);
}
----

.Join different filters with AND combinator
[source,js]
----
async prepare(store) {
    await store.account.cache([
        {
            isDelegate_eq: false,
            balance_gt: 0,
        }
    ]);
}
----

.Caches accounts based on data from the db
[source,js]
----
async prepare(store) {
    /**
     * Get packet account.
     */
    await store.account.cache([
        {
            address: this.recipientId,
        }
    ]);
    /**
     * Get sender and recipient accounts of the packet.
     */
    const pckt = store.account.get(this.recipientId);
    await store.account.cache([
        {
            address_in: [
                pckt.asset.carrier, pckt.asset.sender
            ]
        },
    ]);
}
----


Two very useful filters for the accounts are `asset_contains` and `asset_exists`:

.Caches all accounts that contain the asset key "foo"
[source,js]
----
async prepare(store) {
    await store.account.cache([
        {
            asset_exists: "foo",
        },
    ]);
}
----

.Caches all accounts that contain the value "bar" in their asset
[source,js]
----
async prepare(store) {
    await store.account.cache([
        {
            asset_contains: "bar",
        },
    ]);
}
----

=== Getter

A getter retrieves a single element from the StateStore and requests an account object.

Getters are used inside of the `applyAsset()` and `undoAsset()` functions of a custom transaction.

* get(key) — Retrieve a single element from the store. The key here accepts an address.
* getOrDefault(key) — Get account object from store or create default account if it does not exist.
* find(fn) — Accepts a lambda expression for finding the data that matches the expression.

.Gets the account of the sender
[source,js]
----
const sender = store.account.get(this.senderId);
----

=== Setter

A setter allows changes to be made to the overall StateStore, e.g. updating and saving a property for an amount object.

Setters are used inside of the `applyAsset()` and `undoAsset()` functions of a custom transaction.

* set(key, updatedObject) — Allows updating an account in the database (account is only read-write store).

[source,js]
----
store.account.set(sender.address, newObj);
----

== What is the lifecycle of a transaction?

The lifecycle of a general transaction using the Klayr SDK can be summarized in 7 steps:

. *A transaction is created and signed, (off-chain).* The script to execute this is as follows: `src/create_and_sign.ts`.
. *The transaction is sent to a network.* This can be done by a third party tool, (such as `curl` or `Postman`).
However this can also be achieved by using Klayr Commander, Klayr Desktop or Mobile.
All of the tools need to be authorized to access an HTTP API of a network node.
. *A network node receives the transaction* and after a lightweight schema validation, adds it to a transaction pool.
. *In the transaction pool, the transactions are firstly `validated`.* In this step, only static checks are performed, which include schema validation and signature validation.
. *Validated transactions go to the `prepare` step*, as defined in the transaction class, which to limit the I/O database operations, prepares all the information relevant to properly `apply` or `undo` the transaction.
The store with the prepared data is a parameter of the afore-mentioned methods.
. *Delegates forge the valid transactions into blocks* and broadcasts the blocks to the network.
Each network node performs the `apply` and `applyAsset` steps, after the successful completion of the `validate` step.
. *Shortly after a block is applied, it is possible that a node performs the `undo` step*; (due to decentralized network conditions).
If this occurs, then the block containing all of the included transactions is reverted in favor of a competing block.

While implementing a custom transaction, it is necessary to complete some of these steps.
Often, a base transaction implements a default behavior.
With experience, you may decide to override some of these base transaction methods, resulting in an implementation that is well-tailored and provides the best possible performance for your use case.

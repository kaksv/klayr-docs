== Dependencies

The following dependencies must be installed in order to run applications created with the Klayr SDK:

include::partial$dependencies.adoc[]

[[ports]]
== Ports

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Mandatory:* Always open the *WebSocket* port of your desired network, to enable communication with other peer nodes.

*Optional:* Open the corresponding HTTP port for your network, to ensure your node’s xref:{url_core_api}[API] is reachable.
For more information, please see the diagram on the xref:{url_core_network}[Interact with network] page.
====

To connect to the desired network with Klayr Core, please ensure that the corresponding ports are open:

[options="header",]
|===
|Network |HTTP |WebSocket
|Devnet |4000 |5000
|===

These ports can be altered later in the xref:{url_guides_config}[configuration] file.

[[pre_install]]
== Prerequisites

=== Create a new user

[NOTE]
====
To install the required prerequisites, it is necessary to have a user with sudo rights on the server.
The `klayr` user itself *does not need* any `sudo` rights to run the node.
====

To run and manage a node in the future, please create a separate `klayr` user.
Please execute the following command:

[tabs]
=====
Ubuntu::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
sudo adduser klayr
----
--
MacOS::
+
--
It is not mandatory to set up a `klayr` user, especially when running a local instance for development purposes.
However, if it is required then it is recommended to {url_mac_support}[create the user using the macOS GUI^].
--
=====

=== Toolchain components

This is used for compiling dependencies.

[tabs]
=====
Ubuntu::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
sudo apt install -y libtool automake autoconf curl python-minimal build-essential
----
--
MacOS::
+
--
Ensure that both {url_xcode}[XCode^] and {url_homebrew}[Homebrew^] are installed.

[source,bash]
----
brew install autoconf automake libtool
----
--
=====

include::partial$install-postgres.adoc[]

include::partial$install-node.adoc[]

=== PM2 (optional)

Install {url_pm2}[PM2^] for managing the start/stop process of the application in the background by executing the following command:

[source,bash]
----
npm install pm2 -g
----

== Installation

To install the NPM package {url_npm_sdk}[klayr-sdk^], please execute the following command:

[source,bash]
----
npm install klayr-sdk
----

After successful completion of all the above steps, the Klayr SDK and and all required dependencies are installed.

The next step now is to head to the xref:{url_guides}[Guides] section to learn how to build a blockchain application with the Klayr SDK, or directly head to the xref:{url_tutorials}[Tutorials] to learn how to build proof of concept blockchain applications for real industry use cases.

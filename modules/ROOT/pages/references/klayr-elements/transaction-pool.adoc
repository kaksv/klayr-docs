= Transaction pool
:description: This section covers the installation, updates, constants, specifications and data structures for the transaction pool package of Klayr Elements.
:toc:

The @klayrhq/klayr-transaction-pool package collects, verifies, and provides transactions to the forger module in order to produce a block.

Due to dynamic transaction fees and transaction nonces supported by the Klayr protocol, the transaction pool is required to sort transactions based on a nonce while also maximizing the fee.

The transaction pool has a single list of transactions and a periodic job which sorts and cleans the list as necessary.

== Installation

== Update

To perform an upgrade, execute the following command:

[source,bash]
----
npm update @klayrhq/klayr-transaction-pool
----

== Constants

Transaction-pool-specific constants include names as shown below:

=== Usage

== Terminology

Invalid transaction::  
* A transaction that cannot be applied .
* A transaction that has a nonce value less than the nonce value  stored in the account state.
* A transaction that does not satisfy the specific transaction requirements (example: fails the transaction validation or application logic) .
Processable transaction::
* A transaction that has a correct nonce .
* A transaction that is applicable to the latest blockchain state.
Non-processable transaction::
A transaction that is not applicable to the latest blockchain state, whereby the transaction nonce is larger than the account nonce .
Promote::
The status update of a transaction to “processable” after applying it .
Demote::
The status update of a transaction to “non-processable” due to the arrival of a new transaction, a new block or any change in the account state. 
Evict::
The eviction of transaction(s) from the pool when the list is full .
Discard::
The removal of invalid transactions from the pool .
Reorganize::
A periodic job that promotes, demotes or evicts transactions .

== Specifications

* Access to an account state is required, in order to check if a transaction is non-processable or processable .
* A transaction pool has a maximum transaction limit  for the whole pool (default: 4096).
* Each individual account also has its own maximum transactions limit (default: 64).
* A transaction pool can set a minimum entrance fee priority for transactions to be included.
* A transaction pool can set the minimum replacement fee difference for previous transaction invalidation and replacement.
* A user can opt to invalidate a previously sent transaction by resending a new transaction with the same nonce and a higher fee.
* Transactions in the pool expire after a set amount of time (default: 3 hours).

== Data structures

transactionList::
A list of all the valid transactions (both non-processable or processable) which have arrived via the transport module.
transactionAll::
A list of all received and pending transactions, for checking the existence of, or returning by interface the transactions in the pool.

== Life cycle of transactions in the pool

. Unknown => non-processable .
.. Schema must be valid .
.. Signatures must be valid .
.. `Transaction.nonce >= account.nonce`. 
.. All state changes must be valid.
. Unknown => processable. 
.. All conditions from 1, except `transaction.nonce > account.nonce` .
.. `transaction.nonce === account.nonce `.
. No other transactions in the pool from the same address , with the same nonce.
. Non-processable => processable (Promote). 
.. `Transaction.nonce == account.nonce || transaction.nonce == otherTransactionFromTheSameSender.nonce + 1` .
.. All state changes per transaction are valid.
.. All transactions from the same account which have a correct nonce are all valid when applied together .
. Processable => non-processable .
.. New block arrives and causes some transactions to become invalid .
.. A replacement transaction arrives for a processable transaction with the same nonce, and hence it makes transactions which have a higher nonce unprocessable. 
.. Forger reverts a block and adds transactions back to the transaction pool, which makes transactions from the same account which have a higher nonce unprocessable. 

== Transaction pool jobs

Reorganize::
. Checks each account for promotable transactions .
. Promotes all non-processable transactions which can be processable by applying them together with existing processable transactions .
. Discards all invalid transactions and all subsequent transactions .
Evict::
Evicts all transactions which exceed the expiry time and updates all subsequent transactions from the same account to be non-processable .

== Transaction pool actions

removeTransaction::
Removes a transaction from the list.
All transactions from the same account with a larger nonce are updated to be non-processable. 
addTransaction::
Adds a transaction to the list.
If it is a replacement transaction and has a higher fee, it replaces the older one and subsequent transactions are updated to be non-processable.
If the transaction pool is full and an incoming transaction has a higher fee priority, it should accept the incoming transaction and evict another transaction according to the following rules: 
* Remove non-processable transactions with the lowest feePriority. 
* Remove the lowest feePriority transaction from within the highest nonce transactions for each account .
* Apply the transaction using applyFunction and check if it is PROCESSABLE, UNPROCESSABLE or INVALID.
* If PROCESSABLE or UNPROCESSABLE then add it to transactionList and feePriorityQueue, if INVALID then a relevant error is returned.
getProcessableTransactions::
Provides a copy of processable transactions with a map of accounts to processable transactions, ordered by the nonce. 
getAllTransactions::
Provides a copy of all transactions in the pool .
getTransaction::
Returns a transaction by ID for provision  to another node. 

== Transaction pool events

* On block save: Remove transactions from the pool.
* On block delete: Adds transactions back to the pool.
* On transaction receive:
** Checks if the transaction exists in the pool, then adds it to the pool if the nonce is not lower than the account.
** Rejects the transaction if the nonce is lower than the account.
** If the transaction is the same nonce:
*** Rejects the transaction if it has a lower fee.
*** Replaces the transaction if it has a higher fee.
** If the transaction is non-sequential but it has a larger nonce, it remains in the pool for a limited time.

= Klayr Core Docker Setup

:description: The Klayr Core Docker Setup describes all necessary steps and requirements to install the Klayr SDK with Docker.
:toc:

== Pre-install

This document will detail how to prepare a system to run Klayr Core as a Docker-based container.
To run Klayr in Docker a user must first install the Docker Engine.
Additionally, it is recommended to install Docker Compose for convenience.

Determine if your platform can run Docker.

=== Supported Platforms

Please refer to https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#desktop

[tabs]
====
MacOS::
+
--
Please refer to https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/.
Please note that Docker for Mac already includes Docker Compose.
Install `make` using https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/[XCode].
--
Windows::
+
--
Please refer to https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/.
Please note that Docker for Windows includes Docker Compose.
--
Linux::
+
--
Please refer to https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#server

To install Docker Compose, please refer to https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

IMPORTANT: Configure Docker, so it can be run without `sudo` rights: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/

Install `make` using your package manager.
For example, use `apt-get` if running Ubuntu:

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get install curl make
----

These are the default ports for connecting with the network, these can be altered later in `.env`.

== Installation

=== Get configuration and Makefile

Clone the https://github.com/KlayrHQ/klayr-core[Klayr Core Repository].

[source,bash]
----
sudo -u klayr -i                                    <1>
git clone https://github.com/KlayrHQ/klayr-core.git  <2>
cd klayr-core/docker                                <3>
git checkout master                                <4>
----

<1> switch to klayr user
<2> clone the repository
<3> navigate into docker directory
<4> checkout master branch for last stable version of Klayr Core

It contains a directory `docker` with the following files:

* `.env.development`
* `.env.mainnet`
* `.env.testnet`
* `docker-compose.make.yml`: used by `make coldstart`.
* `docker-compose.override.yml`: use this file to overwrite `KLAYR_` variables (empty by default).
* `docker-compose.redis.yml`: enable cache (optional).
* `docker-compose.yml`
* `Makefile`

The `.env`-files are templates with network specific environment variables.

=== Set environment variables

To connect to the Klayr network, the environment variables need to be set accordingly.

Before setting the variables, you may want to edit them in the respective `.env.<network>` file.

It is recommended to change the password for the database, which is stored in `ENV_KLAYR_DB_PASSWORD`.

To install a specific version of Klayr Core, set the `ENV_KLAYR_VERSION` to the respective version.

After adjusting them, copy the environment variables to a file called `.env`:

[source,bash]
----
cp .env.<network> .env
----

Where `<network>` stands for the Klayr network you want to connect to.

=== Coldstart application

==== Option 1: Makefile

We recommend using the Makefile. Makefile provides a convenient way to xref:administration/docker.adoc#_sync_from_snapshot[sync your node from snapshot]:

[source,bash]
----
make coldstart  <1>
----

<1> will download and restore from a recent blockchain snapshot for you

[NOTE]
====
If you want to synchronize your node starting form the genesis block, it might take a significant amount of time until your local node will be fully syncronized with the blockchain network.
We recommend to use `make coldstart` in case you want/need your node ready to use quickly.
====

[source,bash]
----
make <1>
----

<1> will sync from genesis block on first startup

==== Option 2: docker-compose

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up -d <1>
docker-compose ps    <2>
docker-compose logs  <3>
----

<1> initialize Klayr Core
<2> see the status of Klayr Core
<3> see logs

=== Verify

As final step, verify your node is connected and in sync with the network, e.g. by asking about your nodes’ status by using the API:

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose exec klayr curl http://localhost:<PORT>/api/node/status --header "accept: application/json"
----

Where `<PORT>` is the network specific `httpPort` of your node.

The result should look like this:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "meta": {},
  "data": {
    "broadhash": "ca930994bc1a6a92a47afb7310e3d9903f5e98ce56a6c5fdf444ba34f24c1543",
    "consensus": 94,
    "currentTime": 1558358294074,
    "secondsSinceEpoch": 94249094,
    "height": 8306047,
    "loaded": true,
    "networkHeight": 8306047,
    "syncing": false,
    "transactions": {
      "confirmed": 928836,
      "unconfirmed": 0,
      "unprocessed": 0,
      "unsigned": 0,
      "total": 928836
    }
  },
  "links": {}
}
----

When your node is synced, the values of `networkHeight` and `height` should be (nearly) equal.

To fully verify that your node is in sync with the network, go to the https://explorer.klayr.io/[Klayr Explorer(Mainnet)] or https://testnet-explorer.klayr.io/[Klayr Explorer(Testnet)] and compare the Network height in the explorer with the height of your node.
Again, they should be (nearly) equal.

If needed, use the different Explorer tools for further verification, like comparing the last forged blocks on the chain.

From this point, your node should be fully functional.

As next step, check out xref:administration/docker.adoc[Docker Administration] to learn how to manage your Node.

== Post-installation (optional)

=== Ubuntu

You may want to set up a service for Klayr Core, that takes care of
restarting it automatically after server restarts:

....
# /etc/systemd/system/docker-compose-klayr.service

[Unit]
Description=Docker Compose Application Service
Requires=docker.service
After=docker.service

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/klayr/klayr-core/docker/testnet/
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/docker-compose up
TimeoutStartSec=0
Restart=on-failure
StartLimitIntervalSec=60
StartLimitBurst=3

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
....

[NOTE]
====
*For delegates:* You still need to enable forging manually after a
restart of Klayr Core.
====

To enable the service, run:

[source,bash]
----
systemctl enable docker-compose-klayr
----

Check the service by running:

[source,bash]
----
systemctl status docker-compose-klayr.service <1>
sudo journalctl -u docker-compose-klayr.service <2>
----

<1> display the status of the service
<2> display the logs of the service

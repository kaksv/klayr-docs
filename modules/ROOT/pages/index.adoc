Please read this carefully.
The Klayr SDK is currently in the the alpha release stage.
The Klayr SDK has been released in its current form in order to improve the development experience through community feedback and contributions.

It is definitely NOT recommended to use the alpha release of the Klayr SDK for any production-based blockchain applications, i.e. a blockchain operating on a live mainnet.

Over the course of the Klayr SDK’s alpha phase there will be significant changes in the Klayr protocol and implementation, which will eventually bring the accessibility and reliability to a level which is feasible for production-based blockchain applications.

At this time it is only recommended that the alpha version of the Klayr SDK is used for proof-of-concept blockchain applications, i.e. a blockchain operating on a stand-alone network.

Please note that the dummy delegate accounts are insecure, as their secret passphrases are public.
In addition, the convenient creation of a new genesis block is not supported by the alpha release of the Klayr SDK.

The only application built using the Klayr SDK currently feasible for production usage is {url_github_core}[Klayr Core^] icon:external-link[], the client of the Klayr network itself.

Please be advised that it is not possible to guarantee that blockchains created with the alpha release of the Klayr SDK will remain compatible with the planned (beta/rc) releases.

We wish you an enjoyable experience building your proof-of-concept blockchain applications using the Klayr SDK and look forward to receiving your feedback and contributions during the alpha phase.

== What is the Klayr SDK?

The {url_github_sdk}[Klayr SDK^] is designed to provide an easy and reliable software development kit for building blockchain applications which are compatible with the Klayr Protocol.

The architecture of the Klayr SDK has been designed so that it can be extended to meet the requirements of a wide variety of blockchain use cases.

The codebase is written entirely in JavaScript and TypeScript, which is highly beneficial for the majority of developers, as no significant change of tools are required to get started.

The Klayr SDK makes every effort to ensure developers are easily able to focus purely and simply on writing the code that is required for their own blockchain application and nothing else.

=== SDK components

[width="100%",cols="23%,77%",options="header",]
|===
| Directory | Description
| xref:{url_framework}[Framework] | Klayr Framework is an application framework responsible for establishing and maintaining the interactions between the modules of a Klayr blockchain application.

| xref:{url_elements}[Elements] | Klayr Elements is a collection of libraries, each of them implementing some form of blockchain application functionality such as cryptography, transactions, p2p, etc.
Each library is designed to be compatible with the Klayr Protocol.

| xref:{url_commander}[Commander] | Klayr Commander is a command line tool which allows the management of a Klayr node instance and interaction with a Klayr compatible network.
|===

=== Architecture overview

The Klayr SDK operates on the Node.js runtime and consists primarily of an application framework (xref:{url_framework}[Klayr Framework]).
This consists of a collection of libraries providing blockchain application functionalities (xref:{url_elements}[Klayr Elements]), and a powerful Command Line Interface (xref:{url_commander}[Klayr Commander]), which allows developers to manage a Klayr node instance and interact with a Klayr compatible network.

The diagram below provides a high-level overview of the architecture:

== Usage

=== Dependencies

Before running Klayr SDK, the following dependencies shown below need to be installed in order to run applications created with the Klayr SDK:

[options="header",]
|===
|Dependencies |Version
|Node.js |12.15.0
|PostgreSQL |10+
|Redis (optional) |5+
|Python |2
|===

Further details on installing these dependencies can be found in the xref:{url_setup}[pre-installation setup guide].

Please be aware that primarily it is necessary to create a database.
The default database name is `klayr_dev`, so for the development purposes, a command `createdb klayr_dev --owner klayr` can be used for the set up.
The default database user and password are `klayr` and `password`, they can be both changed in the xref:{url_config}[configuration] of the Klayr SDK.

=== Installation

Installation of the Klayr Alpha SDK is straightforward and limited to getting a single NPM package, `klayr-sdk`, to your Node.js project as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
npm install klayr-sdk
----

Klayr SDK is an all-in-one package that provides the tools to create, run and maintain blockchain applications in JavaScript.

In the case whereby only a specific functionality is required, it is possible to install only the relevant package as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
npm install klayr-commmander <1>
npm install @klayrhq/klayr-transactions <2>
npm install @klayrhq/klayr-cryptography <3>
npm install @klayrhq/klayr-api-client <4>
----

<1> Install Klayr Commander.
<2> Install Klayr Elements transactions package.
<3> Install Klayr Elements cryptography package.
<4> Install Klayr Elements API client package.

TIP: View the xref:{url_elements_packages}[full list of Klayr Elements’ packages]

== Getting started

To get started with the Klayr SDK and the development of a blockchain application, please refer to the following sections in the documentation listed below:

=== How-To Guides

The xref:{url_guides}[Guides] section offers dedicated 'how-to guides' which cover all of the relevant topics required to build a blockchain application with the Klayr SDK.

The guides are arranged in chronological order, however they can also be read separately as well as being used as a source to locate certain commands or code snippets.

=== Tutorials

The xref:{url_tutorials}[Tutorials] explain in detail how to build a specific blockchain application.
All examples provided in the tutorials describe how to implement simple, but valid industry use cases.

The tutorials overview page provides an informative overview about all existing tutorials, including the estimated time and the skill level required to complete each specific tutorial.

TIP: All code for the example apps that is used in the tutorials is also available in the {url_github_sdk_examples}[klayr-sdk-examples repository^] on GitHub.

== Legal disclaimer

By using the Alpha release of the Klayr SDK, you acknowledge and agree that you have an adequate understanding of the risks associated with the use of the Alpha release of the Klayr SDK, and that it is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis; without any representations or warranties of any kind.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event shall the Klayr Foundation or other parties involved in the development of the Alpha release of the Klayr SDK have any liability whatsoever, to any person for any direct or indirect loss, liability, cost, claim, expense, or damage of any kind, whether in contract or in tort; including negligence or otherwise, arising out of or related to the use of all or part of the Alpha release of the Klayr SDK.

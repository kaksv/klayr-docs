== Introduction

The Klayr Core is the program that actually implements the Klayr Protocol.
In order to run a node which will participate in the network the Klayr Core must be installed.
Furthermore, this also applies to every additional machine that is required to run a node.

Setting up the Klayr Core provides the user with the following options:

* The ability to connect to a <<_networks, Network>> and communicate with other nodes in the network.
* To have full control to xref:configuration.adoc[configure] the Klayr Core to specific and custom requirements.
* To create your own <<_snapshots, Snapshot>> of the blockchain.
* Use Klayr Core to perform actions on the Klayr blockchain, e.g. with https://klayr.io/hub[Klayr Desktop].
* xref:configuration.adoc#_forging [Forge] new blocks, (for active delegates).

[NOTE]
====
An instance of the Klayr Core and a Klayr Peer can generally be defined by the following two statements below:

A Klayr Core instance connected to a network is referred to as a Klayr *Node*.

A Klayr Node connected to other Klayr Nodes is referred to as a Klayr *Peer*.

Both statements above refer to a machine which in turn now becomes a server, after the Klayr Core has been installed and executed.
Subsequently, the server now participates in the network and provides the blockchain data to it's clients.

== Getting started

This section provides the most important information in order to begin working with the Klayr Core and the Klayr Mainchain.
Please see the following links below:

* xref:getting-started/interact-with-network.adoc[Interact with the network]
* xref:getting-started/maintain-a-node.adoc[Run your own node]

== Networks

The Klayr Core can be connected to different networks.
Please be aware that there are two key accessible public networks existing which are entirely independent of each other.
These are the *Mainnet* and the *Testnet* which are described below:

=== Mainnet

The Mainnet is where the true Klayr economy exists.
Within this network the Klayr users can transfer KLY tokens from one account to another, register accounts as delegates; and vote for other delegates or register dApps.
For further information, please visit the https://explorer.klayr.io[Klayr Explorer].

=== Testnet

The Testnet is an independent replica of the Klayr Mainnet, whose main function is to test the upgrades first before they are run on the Klayr Mainnet.
Subsequently, this is where new/updated versions and fixes of the Klayr Core are tested.
For further information, please visit the https://testnet-explorer.klayr.io[Klayr Testnet Explorer].

== Distributions

Klayr Core supports the following three distributions listed below:

[tabs]
====
Binary::
+
--
This is the *default* procedure to setup the Klayr Core.
The xref:setup/binary.adoc[Binary] installation consists of a simple and mostly automated procedure to set up the Klayr Core.
This includes almost entirely automated update scripts, coupled with a selection tools to help seamlessly maintain a Klayr Node.
--

Klayr Commander::
+
--
Use xref:setup/commander.adoc[Klayr Commander] to conveniently install and manage Klayr Core.
--
Docker::
+
--
xref:setup/docker.adoc[Docker] adds support for running a Klayr node with other platforms.
For example, running a Klayr node inside of a Docker in Windows, and then connecting it via a custom Node on Klayr Desktop to Klayr Core, without the need to rent an additional server.
--
Source::
+
--
This is designed for anyone wishing to develop and code on the Klayr Core codebase.
It also consists of an extensive test-suite.
Please see more detailed information in the https://github.com/KlayrHQ/klayr-core#tests[README] file.
The installation xref:setup/source.adoc[from Source] enables a developer to work on the latest codebase for the Klayr Core, which may not yet have been tagged for a release.
--
====

== Snapshots

A snapshot is a backup of the complete blockchain.
It can be used to speed up the sync process, instead of having to validate all transactions starting from genesis block to the current block height.
Klayr provides official snapshots of the blockchain which can be found in the following link: http://snapshots.klayr.io.

How to both rebuild from a snapshot, and to create your own snapshots is explained in the Administration section for each <<_distributions, distribution>> of the Klayr Core.

TIP: It is recommended to use xref:administration/binary.adoc#_create_snapshot[Klayr Core Binary] for creating your own snapshots, as a script is provided to conveniently create snapshots.

== Technology stack

The Klayr Core consists of the following 4 main technologies:

[tabs]
====
Node.JS::
+
--
https://nodejs.org[image:nodejs.png[Node.js,title="Node.js"]]

https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] serves as the underlying engine for code execution in the Klayr Core.
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment, that executes the JavaScript code server-side.
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
--
Swagger::
+
--
https://swagger.io[image:swagger-logo.png[Swagger,title="Swagger"]]

https://swagger.io[Swagger] is an open source software framework backed by a large ecosystem of tools that helps developers design, build, document, and consume RESTful Web services.
As part of the Klayr Core documentation, the whole API specification can be explored interactively via the Swagger-UI interface.
--
PostgreSQL::
+
--
https://www.postgresql.org[image:postgresql.png[PostgreSQL,title="PostgreSQL"]]

https://www.postgresql.org[PostgreSQL] is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development; subsequently it has earned a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
All Information on the Klayr mainchain is stored inside of the PostgreSQL databases.
--
Redis::
+
--
https://redis.io[image:redis.png[Redis,title="Redis"]]

https://redis.io[Redis] is an open source, in-memory data structure store.
Klayr Core mainly uses it to cache API responses.
This prevents performance drops in the application.
For example, when the same API request is sent repeatedly.
--
====

== Versioning schemes

Klayr Core is described in 2 different versioning schemes.
The *Software Implementation Version* and the *Protocol Version* as described below:

=== Software implementation versioning

All Klayr Core software changes except for the logging system, are communicated following the exact rules specified by the https://semver.org/[SemVer].

Software implementation versioning has a version prefix `v` followed by a 3 digit notation `<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>` , whereby the individual digits represent the following types of software changes shown below:

....
v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>

v     - Version prefix
MAJOR - Breaking change
MINOR - New feature
PATCH - Bug fix
....

The _software implementation version_ follows the popular SemVer scheme and provides a quick overview for developers about breaking and non-breaking changes in the software.

=== Protocol versioning

The _protocol version_ is denoted by two digits, `H.S.`.
The first digit, `H`, depends on the number of hard forks, and is incremented with each hard fork.
`S` represents the number of soft forks since the last hard fork.

NOTE: The initial protocol version 1.0 is defined as the version that was implemented by Klayr Core v1.0.0.

For example, the _protocol version_ is used in P2P communication between Klayr Core nodes, in order to determine if the nodes have compatible versions of the Klayr protocol implemented.

== Upgrade vs Migration

When to upgrade, and when to migrate Klayr Core?

Every time that a new Klayr Core software update is performed, this introduces a *hard fork* in the network, it is necessary to xref:migration.adoc[migrate] your existing Klayr Core version.

In all other cases the normal *upgrade* process can be performed, according to the distribution being used.
Please see the following upgrade processes listed below:

* xref:upgrade/binary.adoc[Upgrade Klayr Core Binary]
* xref:upgrade/docker.adoc[Upgrade Klayr Core Docker]
* xref:upgrade/source.adoc[Upgrade Klayr Core Source]

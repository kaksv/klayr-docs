=== Create a new user

To run and manage a Klayr Core node in the future, please create a separate `klayr` user as described below:

[TIP]
=====
The `klayr` user itself *does not need* any `sudo` rights to run the Klayr Core.

It is sufficient to create a group `docker`, and then add the newly created user to that group, in order to enable the user to use Docker, (see: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/).
=====

[source,bash]
----
sudo adduser klayr              <1>
sudo groupadd docker           <2>
sudo usermod -aG docker klayr   <3>
----

<1> create a new user
<2> create docker group
<3> add the user to docker group

It is not necessarily required to set up a `klayr` user, especially when you are running a local instance for development purposes.

However, if it is required then it is recommended to create the user using the macOS GUI: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mtusr001/mac

[TIP]

The `klayr` user itself *does not need* any `sudo` rights to run the Klayr Core.

It is not necessarily required to set up a `klayr` user, especially when you are running a local instance for development purposes.

However, if it is required then it is recommended to https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mtusr001/mac[create the user using the MacOS GUI^].

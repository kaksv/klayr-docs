<84> A list of peers to use as seeds when starting the node for the first time.

This should be an array of objects in the following form: [{ip: '123.123.123.123'}, {ip: '111.111.111.111'}]
<92> IP or address of the blacklisted peer.
<93> Time interval in milliseconds,(ms) whereby the nodes performs peer discovery.
<94> The maximum number of inbound peers/connections which the node should have.
This should be an integer.
Peers which initiate the connection to the node will be added to the node’s inbound list.
<95> The maximum number of outbound peers/connections which the node should have.
This should be an integer.
The node will keep trying to connect to new peers until it reaches the maximum number of outbound connections.
<96> The number of milliseconds to ban a peer for, in the case whereby its reputation score falls below 0.
<97> How frequently, (in milliseconds) the outbound list is checked and repopulated, (as peers can drop out over a period of time).
<98> When broadcasting a message such as a block or transaction to peers, this number determines how many peers it will be sent to.
<99> This number indicates the amount of peer information which the node will send back to a peer, when that peer requests the node’s peer list.
<100> This number indicates the maximum amount of peer information which can be received from a single peer, to populate the peer directory with during discovery.
<101> The maximum size in bytes, (integer), of a single peer information object.
A peer information object has a flexible schema, and can contain custom properties/data about the node.
<102> The maximum size in bytes, (integer) of any type of message from a peer.
If the peer tries to send a message greater than this value, it will be immediately disconnected.
<103> When a node tries to make an RPC against a peer, (and expects a response) this value determines the maximum amount of time, (in milliseconds) that the node will wait to receive a response from the peer.
If the peer does not respond in time, then the RPC will fail with an error.
<104> When a node tries to connect to a peer, this value determines the maximum amount of time, (in milliseconds) that the node will wait to complete the handshake with the peer.
If the peer does not complete the handshake in time, then the connection will be closed.
<105> Represents the low-level WebSocket engine which the node should use, (for advanced users).
Possible values are "ws" (default, recommended), and `uws` (This value offers greater performance, however it is not compatible with all systems).

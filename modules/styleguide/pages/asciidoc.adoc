== AsciiDoc & Antora references

The AsciiDoc and Antora documentation can be used as a general reference for creating valid documentation content.

* {url_asciidoc_syntax_reference}[AsciiDoc Quick syntax reference]

* {url_asciidoc_syntax_reference}[AsciiDoc documentation]

* {url_antora_docs}[Antora documentation]

More specific rules and examples of how to create documentation content in AsciiDoc are described in the sections below.

<2> The author of the page (optional).

== Links

=== Link attributes
Always set link attributes to simplify the management of links.

TIP: Please read the guide about {url_asciidoctor_best_practices}[link attributes in AsciiDoc^].

Link attributes are ordered alphabetically.

Naming convention for link attributes:

* Always start with the prefix `url`.
* Use an underscore `_` as the separator between words.
* Describe a link with as few words as possible.
* Be consistent and use the same names for the same links, and similar names for similar links.

.Examples:
[source,asciidoc]
----
:url_github_core: https://github.com/KlayrHQ/klayr-core

:url_guides_config_default_values: klayr-sdk/guides/configuration.html#modify_default_values
----

For more information, see the {url_antora_link_syntax}[Navigation Link Syntax, Content, and Styles^] chapter of the Antora documentation.

Please also refer to the xref:{url_index_links}[Klayr docs link styleguide].

=== Internal links
Internal links are relative links starting from the `pages` folder of a `module`.

.Source: {url_antora_xref}[^]
image:xref-macro-anatomy-diagram.svg[]

Examples for setting different link attributes with internal links from various sources:

[source,asciidoc]
----
:url_index: index.adoc
:url_topic_page: topic/page.adoc
:url_module_page: other-module:page.adoc
:url_component_page: v2@other-component::page.adoc
:url_component_module_page: v2@other-component:module:page.adoc
----

How to add the above defined internal links in the content:

[source,asciidoc]
----
xref:{url_index}[In-module link]
xref:{url_topic_page}[In-module link to a topic folder]
xref:{url_module_page}[Link to another module in the same component]
xref:{url_component_page}[Link to a page in another component in the ROOT module]
xref:{url_component_module_page}[Link to a page in another component in a specific module]
----

=== Anchor links

[IMPORTANT]
====
To have the anchor links working already while creating the content, add the following attriubtes to the content page:

[source,asciidoc]
----
:idprefix:
:idseparator: -
----
====

Anchor IDs are automatically generated from the section titles of a page.

[source,asciidoc]
----
== Some title
=== Sub title
----

Resulting anchor IDs: `#some-title` and `#sub-title`

==== How to link to the ID from the same page

Use the <<anchor-links>> to refer to a section on the same page.

[source,asciidoc]
----
We'll walk through a <<some-title,detailed example>> in this tutorial.
----

==== How to link to the ID from a different page

Set a link attribute.

[source,asciidoc]
----
:url_anotherpage_foobar: another-page.adoc#some-title
----

Use the link attribute in the content.

[source,asciidoc]
----
xref:{url_anotherpage_foobar}[An in-module page anchor link]
----

==== How to create a custom anchor ID
Titles can change and therefore anchor links break easily.
Sometimes it can be useful to set a custom anchor ID:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[[foobar]] <1>
== Some title

It is also possible to place an inline anchor point, for example [[foobar2]]here <2>
----

<1> Changes the anchor ID for the section from `#some-title` to `#foobar`.
<2> Sets an inline anchor ID `foobar2`, which allows jumping to certain parts in the content inside of a sentence.

=== External links
Open external links in a new tab by appending `^` to the link title.

How to define an external link attribute:

[source,asciidoc]
----
:url_github_core: https://other-website.com/url
----

How to place the external link in the content:

[source,asciidoc]
----
{url_github_core}[Link to another website^]
----

== Other page attributes

=== TOC
Add a table of contents.

 :toc:

[NOTE]
====
The table of content is intentionally not visible in the Antora generated docs, as Antora generates a separate toc out of the content.
It still makes sense to include it, to render the table of contents on other occasions, such as on GitHub.
====

=== Next- & Previous links
Set custom Next and Previous links to the end of a page:

[source,asciidoc]
----
:page-previous: /klayr-sdk/index.html
:page-previous-title: Overview
:page-next-title: Getting Started
:page-next: /klayr-sdk/getting-started.html
----

Don’t show Next or Previous links at the end of a page.

[source,asciidoc]
----
:page-no-previous: true
:page-no-next: true
----

=== HTML meta descriptions

If the page doesn't provide an adequate introduction sentence, add this attribute to provide web crawlers with an HTML meta description for this page.

 :description: The Klayr SDK Setup page describes...

== Line breaks
For every new sentence, use a new line.
This keeps a better overview while writing.
Asciidoctor will still render the text as one paragraph.

To start a new paragraph use 2 new lines.

[source,asciidoc]
----
Use one line for each sentence.
This maintains a better overview while writing.
Asciidoctor will still render the text as one paragraph.

To start a new paragraph use 2 new lines.
----

Avoid line breaks if possible. However, if it is necessary then add a `+` at the end of the line.

[source,asciidoc]
----
This is one line, +
And here starts a new line!
----

== Capitalization

* Use capital letters for product names.
* Don't capitalize words in a heading which you wouldn't capitalize in a normal sentence.
* ID is always written all uppercase (except in variable names).
* Transaction types are always written all lowercase (Except in variable names, e.g. `RegisterDelegateTransaction`), e.g.:
+
> In DPoS systems, each account that has enough balance to send a delegate registration transaction and hasn’t done so before, can register a new delegate on the network.

== Images

Images are saved in the `modules/ROOT/assets/images` folder.

If you include an image on a page, set the `:imagesdir:` attribute, to make sure it will be displayed in your editor preview and on GitHub.

The `imagesdir` path needs to be always relative to the location of the current page.

.Example
 :imagesdir: ../assets/images

After placing the `imagesdir` attribute, insert an image by referring to its file name.

 image:banner_sdk.png[Logo]

== Admonitions

Use Admonitions to highlight important statements for the user.

=== Single line Admonitions

[source,asciidoc]
----
NOTE: General information to highlight.
TIP: To explain short cuts, best practices, optional tips.
IMPORTANT: Highlight important content, that the user should not miss.
CAUTION: Highlight content, where the user has to be careful.
WARNING: Warn users about bad consequences that can happen.
----

TIP: To explain short cuts, best practices, optional tips.

IMPORTANT: Highlight important content, that the user should not miss.

CAUTION: Highlight content, where the user has to be careful.

WARNING: Warn users about bad consequences that can happen.

=== Multi line Admonitions
[source,asciidoc]
----
[NOTE]
====
This is a multi-line admonition.

It can also have other elements included, such as lists:

* one
* two
* three
====
----

====

== Headings

Use the following heading levels, never skip heading levels on a page and always use only one H0 title.
Titles are being written in sentence case, i.e. small letters except for the first letter of the first word, names or abbreviations.

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Title
== Subtitle
=== Sub-subtitle
== 2nd subtitle
----

== Monospace
The font `Monospace` should be used in the following cases:

* Variables
* File names

 Open file `path/to/file.js` and create a new variable `test`.

== Code snippets

Use the following syntax for displaying code snippets:

.Bash script example
 [source,bash]
 ----
 mkdir folder
 cd folder
 ----

This syntax allows specifying the language of the code in the snippet, which will highlight the code accordingly in the UI.

Commonly used languages in the docs are as follows:

* `js`: JavaScript
* `jsx`: React JSX
* `typescript`: TypeScript
* `bash`: Bash
* `json` : JSON

For code snippets that do not require a syntax highlight, just omit the language option or as an alternative prepend a space in front of each code line.

=== Titles for code snippets

Give a code snippet a title by adding a link starting with a dot.

 .myproject/src/
 [source,bash]
 ----
 mkdir folder
 cd folder
 ----

[TIP]
====
It is good practice to include the current file path of the file which contains the code snippet as a title.

xref:CONTRIBUTING.adoc[How to contribute to the Klayr Documentation]

== Overview

Content::
The Content of the whole Klayr documentation is stored in branches:
+
----
docs-core
docs-sdk
----
Documentation for previous versions of the SDK and Core is stored in branches following the naming convention:
+
----
docs-core-VERSION
docs-sdk-VERSION
----
where `VERSION` is always referring to the corresponding software version.

UI::
The presentation of the documentation is stored completely seperate form the actual content.
It's stored on the `antora` branch.

Building::
The `build` branch stores the `site.yml` file, which is used to generate the Klayr Documentation using Antora.

== Building the documentation

General workflow to follow, to update the Klayr documentation.

=== Prerequisites

The following software packages are required:

- make
- node.js
- antora (`npm install --global @antora/cli@2.1 @antora/site-generator-default@2.1`)
- gulp (`npm install --global gulp-cli`)

It's also required to have the `antora` and `master` directories setup as working trees to their respective branches.
This can be done like so:

```
git worktree add master master
git worktree add antora antora
```

Note: if you're making a pull request against either the master or antora branches, you might want to temporarily use different branches instead. Refer to `man git worktree` for further details

You'll notice that if you do a `git branch` now that you have 3 branches checked out.

=== Build Steps

Building at this point should be as simple as running `make`

Once this is complete, the changes will be in the `master` directory/branch and ready for committing and pushing.

[source,bash]
----
make
cd master
git add .
git commit -m "Docs update"
git push origin master
----

==== Build Details

It's a 2 step process where the UI bundle is built first followed by the static site which uses the UI bundle.

This can be done manually by going into the antora directory and running:
`git pull origin antora && npm ci && gulp bundle`

More details on this can be found in antora/README.adoc

And then, from the root directory, running `antora site.yml`.

=== Generate API spec

. Generate Asciidoc files from swagger spec
+
[source,bash]
----
cd klayr-sdk/framework/src/modules/http_api/schema
swagger2markup convert -i ./swagger.yml -d ~/swagger-spec
----
. Merge generated files and remove outdated links from description.

=== Update Aloglia search index

[source,bash]
----
cd docsearch-scraper
pipenv run ./docsearch docker:run ./config.json
----
